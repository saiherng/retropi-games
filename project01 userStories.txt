As a gamer I would like to be able to run any previously compatible retro game on the RetroPi
so I don't have to worry about downloading specific files each time.

As a gamer I want to be able to have access to a library of every game available for each console
so I will always have access to them.

As a student I want a RetroPi that's easy to use so I don't have to do much thinking when setting
up the RetroPi during my study breaks.

Acceptance Criteria
---------------------

I can run any compatible game ROM on the RetroPi.

I have access to a source page for all classic ROMS.

I can easily setup my RetroPi with no hassles.
